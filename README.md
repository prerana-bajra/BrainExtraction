# Abstract— 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a powerful medical imaging technique that provides detailed visualization of internal body structures, including the brain. By utilizing a combination of strong magnetic fields and radio waves, MRI captures high-resolution images without exposing patients to ionizing radiation. Brain extraction, or skull stripping, is an essential step in T2-weighted MRI analysis, as it accurately isolates the brain region from non-brain structures. In this paper, an approach for brain extraction is proposed using image processing techniques. Our method incorporates Otsu’s thresholding, morphological operations (erosion and dilation), and the extraction of the largest connected component. The performance of the approach is evaluated on T2-weighted MRI images. Although the method successfully extracts the brain, further improvements are needed to enhance its accuracy and robustness. The proposed approach offers an alternative to computationally intensive AI-driven algorithms and provides efficient brain identification and extraction in T2-weighted MRI.
